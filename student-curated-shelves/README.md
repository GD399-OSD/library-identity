In order to invite a more diverse and to expansive part of the MICA community to contribute back to the library's space, I propose that a set of shelves in the upper floor of the library be turned into student-curated shelves.

Essentially, it would work like this:

- Signs near the shelves invite students to take books they like or want others to see from the lower level and reshelve them upstairs on the designated shelves.
- Students can then look through these books and check them out as they want.
- After about two weeks, the library staff reshelve the remaining books where they belong downstairs and the cycle starts again.
- I propose that these shelves act as replacements for a couple of the new books shelves against the glass wall on the upper level of Decker so that people walking into Bunting see the new feature.

Additionally, it would be great to have designed slips of paper located strategically around the library that students can insert into books on the shelves to indicate that a student finds the book valuable or important.
Things that would go on these sheets:
- Name? / Major?
- Why do you think others should read this book?
- What kinds of people should read this book?
